Source files for retexturing BillboardZ DayZ Mod by THYER5 and Knaze.

This mod structure contains all the files and code necessary to retexture our BillboardZ Mod <LINK>.  You can find tutorial videos on how to acheive this here <LINK>, if required either THYER5 or Knaze can provide retexture services for a fee.

This mod is designed with Server Owners in mind, offering the ability to control the Billboards and Signs we offer instead of paying for a repack and still having to do the same work.  See EXTRAS folder for TYPES files, you will need to add these to your blah blah blah
